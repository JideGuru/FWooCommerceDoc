					<b>Flutter</b>
				</h3>
				<img src="assets/images/flutter.png" width="40"/>
				<p>
					Flutter is an open-source mobile application development SDK created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android and iOS, as well as being the primary method of creating applications for Google Fuchsia, Flutter widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

				</p>
				<p>
					The first version of Flutter was known as codename "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit, with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second. During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai, Google announced Flutter Release Preview 2 which is the last big release before Flutter 1.0. On December 4th, 2018, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the first "stable" version of the Framework.

Ecommerce is rapidly growing worldwide and WooCommerce has over 39 million downloads as a plugin and is currently active on more than three million websites and is the most popular eCommerce platform in 2018. WooCommerce has approximately 4% of the top million HTML pages.

		<h5>Before you start</h5>
		<li>This documentation was created to help you with the installation and configuration of Flutter WooCommerce application. Please, read it carefully to avoid most of potential problems with incorrect configuration.</li>

		<li>This chapter describes how to install Flutter, Android Studio and Xcode(to build for ios only for people with MacOS X). You don't have to install Android Studio, but it's better. The project can be built without Android Studio, using VSCode or IntelliJ with Gradle build system.</li>

		<br>
		<h4><b>Set up Android Studio</b></h4>
		<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">For more Information</a><br><br>

		<img src="assets/images/studiosite.png" width="700px" alt="Studio" />
		<br><li><b>For Windows</b></li>
		Download <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">.exe file from here</a> and launch. After launching, follow the installation guide.<br><br>

		<li><b>For Mac</b></li>
		<li>1. Download <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">.dmg file from here</a>.</li>
		<li>2. Launch the Android Studio DMG file.</li>
		<li>3. Drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder, then launch Android Studio.</li>
		<li>4. Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings, then click OK.</li>
		<li>5. The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development.</li><br><br>


		<li><b>For Linux</b></li>
		<li>1. Download <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">.zip file from here</a> and launch. After launching, drag the Android Studio into the Applications folder.</li>
		<li>2. Unpack the .zip file you downloaded to an appropriate location for your applications, such as within /usr/local/ for your user profile, or /opt/ for shared users.</li>
		<li>3. Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings or not, then click OK.</li>
		<li>4. The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development.</li>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h3 id="changeIcon"><strong>E) Change App Icon</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h2>Android</h2>
		<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJ3aB.png" width="700px" alt="IMG">
		<p>Right click the <code>android</code> folder in your project outline. Go to <strong>New &gt; Image Asset</strong>. Now you can select an image to create your launcher icon from. </p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I usually use a <code>1024x1024</code> pixel image but you should certainly
		  use nothing smaller that <code>512x512</code>. If you are using Gimp or Inkscape, you
		  should have two layers, one for the foreground and one for the
		  background. The foreground image should have transparent areas for the
		  background layer to show through.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DL2VV.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DL2VV.png" width="700px" alt="IMG"></a></p>

		<p>This will replace the current launcher icons. You can find the generated icons in the <code>mipmap</code> folders:</p>
		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7ax9.png" width="300"></p>
		<p>If you would prefer to create the launcher icons manually, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46196511/3681880">this answer</a> for help.</p>

		<p>Finally, make sure that the launcher icon name in the AndroidManifest is the same as what you called it above (<code>ic_launcher</code> by default):</p>

		<pre><code>application android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
		</code></pre>

		<p>Run the app in the emulator to confirm that the launcher icon was created successfully.</p>

		<h1>iOS</h1>

		<p>I always used to individually resize my iOS icons by hand, but if you have a Mac, there is a free app in the Mac App Store called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/icon-set-creator/id939343785?l=en&amp;mt=12" rel="noreferrer">Icon Set Creator</a>. You give it an image (of at least <code>1024x1024</code> pixels) and it will spit out all the sizes that you need (plus the <code>Contents.json</code> file). Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45122603/3681880">this answer</a> for the suggestion.</p>

		<p>iOS icons should not have any transparency. See more guidelines <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

		<p>After you have created the icon set, start Xcode (assuming you have a Mac) and use it to open the <code>ios</code> folder in your Flutter project. Then go to <strong>Runner > Assets.xcassets</strong> and delete the AppIcon item.</p>

		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lb9io.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lb9io.png" width="700px" alt="IMG"></a></p>

		<p>After that right-click and choose <strong>Import...</strong>. Choose the icon set that you just created.</p>

		<p>That's it. Confirm that the icon was created by running the app in the simulator.</p>

		<h3>If you don't have a Mac...</h3>

		<p>You can still create all of the images by hand. In your Flutter project go to <code>ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset</code>.</p>

		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9CKd.png" width="350" ></p>

		<p>The image sizes that you need are the multiplied sizes in the filename. For example, <code>Icon-App-29x29@3x.png</code> would be <code>29</code> times <code>3</code>, that is, <code>87</code> pixels square. You either need to keep the same icon names or edit the JSON file.</p>
